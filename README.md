<h1 align = "center">Movie Data</h1> 


<p align = "center">Who doesn't love movies?! I created a movie directory to show some top movies, and also allow the user to input data about their best movie choices too</p>

<p align = "center">The page has a movie cover background, and uses a dark blue and grey colour palette. The user can interact with the movies under the comment box, by clicking on each one to make it bigger.</p>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Key Learnings</h3></b>
<p align = "center">WOOOW! This project has been an incredible learning curve for me and my Javascript knowledge. I really enjoyed having a set of lines to work with at the start as it pushed my imagination further with what I could do with it. I also liked how creative I was with this project.</p>

<p align = "center">With this project, I took ideas from different projects of mine to make something bigger with it. I used flexbox, and then click panels from different projects, and the comment box, to bring it all together onto one page.</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p align = "center">1.I wasn't able to complete the task assigned for this project. I struggled for a few different parts. Mostly, I think the way I presented the data was wrong and instead should have been by recalling the variables of each movie. Without this, I couldn't have the user edit the data<br><br>
2. I cannot work out how to have a separate div for submission, hence why currently if more than one is submitted, it'll go under the text of the first one. I think this can be done by creating a new div each time (like the p) but then I wouldn't know how to make sure it was given the class panel<br><br>
3. The picture looks weird when you reduce the screen size. In an idea world, I wanted the image to cover the panel and then have it be slightly opaque, however when I did this, it made the text opaque too</p>
