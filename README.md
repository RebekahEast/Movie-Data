<h1 align = "center">Movie Data</h1> 


<p align = "center">Who doesn't love movies?! I created a movie directory to show some top movies, and also allow the user to input data about their best movie choices too</p>

<p align = "center">The page has a movie cover background, and uses a dark blue and grey colour palette. The user can interact with the movies under the comment box, by clicking on each one to make it bigger.</p>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Key Learnings</h3></b>
<p align = "center">WOOOW! This project has been an incredible learning curve for me and my Javascript knowledge. I really enjoyed having a set of lines to work with at the start as it pushed my imagination further with what I could do with it. I also liked how creative I was with this project.</p>

<p align = "center">With this project, I took ideas from different projects of mine to make something bigger with it. I used flexbox, and then click panels from different projects, and the comment box, to bring it all together onto one page.</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p align = "center">1. Instead of recalling the array one by one, I would have liked to recall like the way I do on the webiste (pets page)<br><br>
2. I would have liked the boxes to appear smaller and in a better format than they do right now - it looks too large and chunky<br><br>
3. form validation</p>
